[oogl.js](http://oogljs.com/) was definitely in need of enhancements. The final 1.0 release is on the way, but before these days it was lacking a decent asynchronous asset loading system with progress feedback.

I have now provided oogl.js with a great one and also managed in making other improvements and bugfixes. oogl.js's playground is a test game you can find in another repository of mine, [Prelude of the Chambered](http://71104.github.io/chambered).

As the observant reader will argue, I didn't invent Prelude of the Chambered: I'm just copying it from [Notch](http://notch.tumblr.com/) using WebGL. You will also notice the "(You *don't* need Java to play this)" banner at the bottom.

By the way, seems like copying Notch games is turning into an international hobby: tl;dr, but from his latest Tumblr post it seems some folks copied 0x10c. Not to talk about all the Minecraft clones around, even WebGL-based.

Anyways, anyways. oogl.js is now ready and I wanna thank Yanko Petrovic for his precious feedback.
