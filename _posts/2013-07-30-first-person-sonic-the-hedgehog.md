So we were Facebooking at our homes despite the wonderful sunny day, chicks at the beach and so on, you know, that kind of get-a-life things.

One of [us](http://open.laboratorio.tv/ "OpenLab Roma") posted this disturbing video on Facebook featuring a severely retarded player playing the first level of [Sonic the Hedgehog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%28series%29 "<3"), one of the most beautiful videogames ever made, remade in 3D.

It actually didn't feature any Sonic as it was first-person, and it actually pretty sucks.

We also found [past attempts](http://coreh.github.io/WebSonic/ "Yuck...") to create a 3D online version of Sonic the Hedgehog and it sucks as well (it doesn't even work any more).

We hate when something isn't made fine.
