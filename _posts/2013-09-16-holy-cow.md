Have you ever tried the [Oculus Rift](http://www.oculusvr.com/)? Oh you haven't? You should.

Before I tried it I was like oh yeah, nice, another very much cool VR thing, amazing, very interesting, talk about how fast science evolves, human progress and stuff.

Now that I've tried it I'm kinda like

**OH MY FUCKING GOD I CANT EVEN HOLY CRAP WHAT THE I CAN'T I JUST OH MY FUCKING GOD OH GOD**.

I was going to to fall from the chair.

Actually the demos I tried were pretty good, there are crappy ones as well and some feature such inaccurate motion responses they'll give you sickness. But still.

I find myself forced to retreat what I have told in previous posts:

Sonic the Hedgehog _will_ feature first-person playing. Not everybody owns a Rift of course (yet), so that'll be just an option: the user will play in third person by default and optionally enable Rift support which will project him right into the marvellous world of Sonic, the Hedgehog.

It's not first-person playing, we're not eliminating the beloved hedgehog character: we're doing something different, we are allowing folks to visit Sonic's world and see what it looks like from the inside. It's different.

You think it isn't? You haven't tried the Rift.
